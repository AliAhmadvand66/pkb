1532733	adopt a highway	SUMMARY	Adopt a Highway
1532733	adopt a highway	EXPLANATION	Adopting a highway to help control the litter on public roads has been around since 1984. The highway litter control effort originated in Texas when a Texas Department of Transportation engineer named James Evans and public information officer named Billy Black became enraged by the amount of litter collecting on the Texas highways. Black made the process of adopting a highway easy with volunteer training, reflective vests, and organized clean-up days. The first volunteers for highway clean up was the Tyler Civitan Club with a section of Highway 69 in Texas. Today the idea of corporations, clubs, and individuals making an effort to clean up their local highways has spread to 49 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. More than 90,000 groups know how to adopt a highway and participate. Not only do the groups receive the goodwill advertising on a sign on their section of adopted highway, but they can also realize the personal satisfaction of doing something for the environment.

GBBs have a high FPS (usually depending), can be automatic, but they are usually semi, but you need gas and you need to keep buying gas.  However the gas powered (not C02) airsoft guns become exponentially less reliable in cold weather, and the plastic parts found in many cheaper airsoft guns are prone to breaking. investing in a gun with metal internals will greatly increase the reliability and performance of your gun.

1480031	apply for child support	SUMMARY	Apply for Child Support
1480031	apply for child support	EXPLANATION	Child support refers to the financial aspect of taking care of a child's needs and is the legal responsibility of both parents, regardless of the couple's relationship status. If a child's parents are married to each other when that child is born and both parents' names go on the birth certificate, then it is already established that both parents assume fiscal responsibility for the child and, in cases of divorce, designations for financial support are generally included along with the custody agreement. However, when a child's parents are not married at the time of the child's birth and/or paternity has not yet been established, it may be necessary to apply for a court ordered child support arrangement in order to mandate a parent's financial contribution to caring for that child. If that is the case, follow these guidelines for how to apply for child support.

Your company's human resources manager will be able to tell you whether or not a 401(k) plan is a benefit offered.
51994	ballroom dance	SUMMARY	Ballroom Dance
51994	ballroom dance	EXPLANATION	So you want to ballroom dance?  You're about to enter a world of class, tradition, and loads of fun.  The good news is it's easier than you can imagine.  The bad news is you'll still need to work. Ballroom dance is a somewhat artificial category including many styles of traditional partner dances from several parts of the world and different eras. The thing in common is the expectation that the dance is polite and the dancer's dance-floor relationship somewhat formal (Ballroom dancing is never "Dirty Dancing"--even the more sensual styles such as the Tango are stylized. The sexuality of the dance exists in innuendo, not in hot and sweaty contact between the dancers).

1567764	beat egg whites	SUMMARY	Beat Egg Whites
1567764	Egg Whites	EXPLANATION	Separate the egg whites. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to very carefully pass the bright yellow yolk of the egg from one half of the shell to the other over a bowl, allowing the clearer white of the egg to dribble out. Do this several times until most of the egg white has dripped into the bowl. Place the yolk in your second bowl. Be careful not to allow any pieces of eggshell into either bowl. Carefully pick them out if necessary.
1567764	Egg Whites	EXPLANATION	Whisk the eggs. Lower your whisk into the egg whites and begin to move it in tight circles by moving your wrist sharply up and down in a circular motion. Start slowly and then speed up. You don't want to go too fast, and consistency is key.
1567764	Egg Whites	EXPLANATION	Keep beating. The recipe you are working from will probably describe to you the ideal consistency of the egg whites. Take your whisk out of the bowl and point the whisking end up to form peaks, allowing you to judge the stiffness. Whisking can be tiring, and you may be tempted to switch hands. This is fine as long as both hands can keep up a consistently quick rhythm.
1567764	Egg Whites	EXPLANATION	If it asks for stiff peaks, stop when the egg whites firm up and begin to form peaks that stand up sharply on their own.
147294	Garrador	EXPLANATION	Fire the rocket launcher (if you have it) at the door at the other end.  It kills everyone in the room, and it saves you a whole bunch of health and ammo.

147294	Garrador	EXPLANATION	Try to get a rocket launcher. If you don't have one, and cannot backtrack to get one, read the following to beat the garradors with other weapons:
147294	Garrador	EXPLANATION	Handgun only.  Walk forward and alert the two Zealots.  Walk into the corner close to the door, and kill them here.  The Garradors will not hear.  Next, walk up the stairs.  For some reason the Garradors will turn around, and get their claws stuck in the wall.  Run up to them, and take about 4 shots in each of their backs.  They will scream in pain and stay there for about 8 seconds.  Now, run into the tunnel, and shoot the Zealot in his knee.  Suplex him, and he will die.  When the Garradors come, they will get their claws stuck for SURE!  When they do, run to the bottom where you entered.  For some reason, they continue to roam the tunnels.  Once here throw a grenade at the last set of Zealots, or go into the corner and shoot them there.  Then, all you need to do, is shoot the bell, and get about three shots in there back.  Done!
147294	Garrador	EXPLANATION	Knife only.  O.K, this will be very hard.  It's best to go anywhere (walk) and kill the Zealots.  When they are about to attack, back it, then rush in and knife.  Then focus on the Garradors.  (Stay on the bottom floor!) Run around and one will charge.  Dive out of the way, and begin knifing his back.  When he turns, don't run!  Stay there!  The other Garrador will stay up there if you are luck.  Keep turning so you are facing his back, and knife away.  After a while he will die.  Pick up the money and repeat for the next blind guy.  After this, you have 30, 000 pesetas. Go to the merchant and buy a gun!

However, nothing says "I'm a hardcore Rise Against fan" like a Rise Against t-shirt. You can pick up some cheap clothes on websites like Amazon and Ebay, just make sure it's what you really want before you buy it; you may not be able to get a refund. Shop around too, you can find some seriously cheap shirts if you look around.
2301072	Rise Against	EXPLANATION	Tell people about them. Rise Against didn't get famous through advertising, they got famous through word of mouth. If every one of their fans thought talking about them was a bad idea, they wouldn't be where they are now. Tell your friends that you've found this new band and ask them to listen to them. If they don't like them, it's their choice. If they do like them, you've given Rise Against another fan, what a great fan you are! Don't talk about them too much though, it can get annoying. Also, don't talk about them like you're an expert, the person you're talking to could be an expert themselves. If you're certain that the person knows nothing of Rise Against, go ahead and show off a tiny bit. Make sure the person knows that you're joking though, not making them look stupid.

1400268	boil crab legs	SUMMARY	Boil Crab Legs
1400268	boil crab legs	EXPLANATION	There are several different ways of preparing crab legs, including baking, steaming, and even grilling. But one of the quickest, and surely tastiest, ways to prepare crab legs is to boil them. Learn how to boil crab legs to help the crab meat retain its flavor, and you'll be ready to enjoy them in less than 10 minutes.
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Purchase frozen crab legs from the supermarket, as this ensures the best taste. Frozen crab legs — doesn't that compromise their flavor? Actually, frozen crab legs usually taste better than thawed crab legs, as the thawed legs do not retain the familiar taste and freshness found in frozen ones. Why is this?
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Buy enough crab legs per person. How much crab should you buy? The general idea is that if you're planning on serving the legs with a side or two, 2 to 4 legs per person is ideal as a main course. Because crab can get pretty expensive, it's also possible to serve crab legs as an appetizer. One crab leg per person is more than sufficient as an appetizer.
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Keep the crab legs frozen until you plan on boiling them. You don't need to defrost them before cooking, and you certainly shouldn't microwave them. Because they are already pre-cooked, they keep quite well.
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Rinse off the crab legs, set aside, and fill a large saucepan or pot halfway with cold water. Add salt or seasoning, if desired. Turn the stove on high, and allow the water to come to a boil. If you want to get fancy with your boiling medium or added ingredients, try out these suggestions:
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Drop in the crab legs and wait for the boiling liquid to return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and let the crab legs boil for 4 to 5 minutes for smaller varieties of crab, 7 to 8 for larger varieties, and up to 15 minutes for colossal. Remove from heat immediately. Remember, you're most likely not cooking them so much as reheating them.
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Remove the crab legs from the boiling water, let drain, and serve with clarified butter. Serve immediately. In order to make clarified butter, do the following:
1400268	crab legs	EXPLANATION	Most crab legs available at the supermarket were cooked on the fishing boat immediately after they were caught, and then flash frozen.

5604896	enamel paint	EXPLANATION	Enamel paint is a paint that air dries to hard usually glossy,finish used for coating surfaces that are outdoors or otherwise subject to hard wear or variations in temperature; it should not be confused with decorated objects in "painted enamel", where vitreous enamel is applied with brushes and fired in a kiln. The name is something of a misnomer, as in reality, most commercially available enamel paints are significantly softer than either vitreous enamel or stoved synthetic resins, and are totally different in composition; vitreous enamel is applied as a powder or paste and then fired at high temperature. There is no generally accepted definition or standard for use of the term enamel paint, and not all enamel-type paints may use it.Typically the term "enamel paint" is used to describe oil-based covering products, usually with a significant amount of gloss in them, however recently many latex or water-based paints have adopted the term as well. The term today means "hard surfaced paint" and usually is in reference to paint brands of higher quality, floor coatings of a high gloss finish, or spray paints. Most enamel paints are alkyd resin based. Some enamel paints have been made by adding varnish to oil-based paint.Although "enamels" and "painted enamel" in art normally refer to vitreous enamel, in the 20th century some artists used commercial enamel paints in art, including Pablo Picasso (mixing it with oil paint), Hermann-Paul, Jackson Pollock, and Sidney Nolan. The Trial (1947) is one of a number of works by Nolan to use enamel paint, usually Ripolin, a commercial paint not intended for art, also Picasso's usual brand. Some "enamel paints" are now produced specifically for artists.

212213	Who	EXPLANATION	Pace yourself. Reality itself exists and happens one present moment at a time. Do not allow the burden of your whole life to rest on you all at once. Focus on you and the here and now and determine for yourself that you will take life one step at a time. Take life one day at a time from the paradigm that each day affords an opportunity to partake of and pursue perfection. Cherish the notion that life is an odyssey of hope of the most elite sort, which suggests having an indomitable belief that there is always a better beyond to navigate towards and that there is always a viable possibility that you can possess this noble dream as your destiny.
212213	Who	EXPLANATION	Keep some perspective. The end-of-life-as-we-know-it has long been predicted, in fact in the last ninety years or so, it's been scheduled to arrive about every five years, or about every five minutes, depending on who you were talking to. And yet here you are today, looking at something on the internet.Think of the people you have known in your lifetime. We all can remember lots of people in every time of our personal history, and of human history, having to make uncomfortable short-term decisions and transitions, for all sorts of long-term and short-term reasons.Contemplate whether it is wise to allow apprehension with regard to relatively temporary discomfort to deprive you of the everlasting pride of living up to your expectations for yourself and possibly also others' expectations of you? Realize that such would be unwise and bravely launch yourself on an upward trajectory.

149499	lucid dream	SUMMARY	Lucid Dream
149499	lucid dream	EXPLANATION	Lucid dreaming is awareness that you are dreaming. This awareness can range from very faint recognition of the fact to something as momentous as a broadening of awareness beyond what has ever been experienced even in waking life.  Lucid dreams usually occur while a person is in the middle of a regular dream and suddenly realizes that they are dreaming. This is called a dream-initiated lucid dream.  A wake-initiated lucid dream occurs when you go from a normal waking state directly into a dream state, with no apparent lapse in consciousness. Once you realize this, you have the ability to control your dreams, which is pretty much the most essential part of lucid dreaming.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	Keep a dream journal. This is perhaps the most important step towards lucid dreaming. Keep it close by your bed at night, and write in it immediately after waking. Or you can keep a recording device if you find it easier to repeat your dream out loud. This helps you recognize your common dream elements (people from your past, specific places, etc.), and also tells your brain that you are serious about remembering your dreams! It will also help you to recognize things that are unique to your dreams. You will be able to recognize your own "dream signs." These will be recurring things or events that you may notice in your dreams.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	Learn the best time to have a lucid dream. By being aware of your personal sleep schedule, you can arrange your sleep pattern to help induce lucid dreams.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	Try Stephen Laberge's mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming (MILD) technique.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	Studies strongly suggest that a nap a few hours after waking in the morning is the most common time to have a lucid dream.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	Lucid dreams are strongly associated with REM sleep.  REM sleep is more abundant just before the final awakening.  This means they most commonly occur right before waking up.  (Sleep-onset REM is a symptom of narcolepsy.  If you have lucid dreams right after falling asleep, you may wish to consider seeking medical advice from a sleep medicine specialist. However, there are studies which show people can recall dreams after being awakened during non-REM sleep).
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	If random thoughts pop up when you are trying to fall asleep, repeat the imagining, self-suggestion part, and try again. Don't worry if you think it's taking a long time. The longer it takes, the more likely it will 'sink in,' and the more likely you will have a lucid dream.
149499	Lucid	EXPLANATION	After you wake up, stay up for an hour with your mind focused on lucidity and lucidity only.

Or, just go where the bus takes you...A decent itinerary might have you landing at Ben Gurion (where you should expect to be efficiently profiled, separated, and quizzed by smiling young Israelites), with a quick trip into the very cosmopolitan Tel Aviv (which is hardly in the holy land, by most accounts) for lunch, and then on to Jerusalem for your first couple of days; putting off a decision to head north or south until later, when you've determined whether to head into the more populous, workaday north, or the arid south through the Negev desert and the bulk of the Kibbutzim (Kibbutzes) to Eilat, the "resort" destination for Israelites, on the way into the Sinai (they pronounce it SINeye)...there is much to see here, in either direction; why not do both?
